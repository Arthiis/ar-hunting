Hey, thanks for downloading this resource,

This is a basic, hunting script for FiveM - This will spawn a custom amount of deer in a few locations, these animals will be checked for population, will hopefully act normal (maybe) and once you have killed them, you will be able to use qb-target to target and butcher them for meat, the animation is just a simple one, but it does the trick. Once butchered the player gets meat to ps-inventory and the animal dissapears. 

here's a few Q&A's

    What version of QBCore do I need to use?
    I used version 2.1.0

    Will you create a version for other systems like ESX or QBox?
    No

    Will you support if I get any errors?
    No

    What do I need?
    This script uses QBCore and QB-Targeting, it uses ps-inventory (https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-inventory) and highly recommend it.

    Will this work with other inventory scripts / targeting scripts?
    No.

    Will you make this script work with other inventory scripts / targeting scripts?
    I mean... maybe? if the demand requires it?

    Do I need any other scripts like ox_lib to run this?
    Not to my knoweldge.

    Why is it free?
    It's not about the money. But if you feel like contributing, you could always buy me a Ko-fi (https://ko-fi.com/arthiis)
